# MXSideMenu

MXSideMenu is a simple project for adding a side menu like the one used on the Facebook, Path and Google+ iOS apps. 

# How to use
- Copy the files MXSideMenuViewController.h, MXSideMenuViewController.m and MXSideMenuViewController.xib into your project.
- In you AppDelegate.h modify your - (BOOL)application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: so it looks like this:


  ```objective-c
    self.window = [[UIWindow alloc] initWithFrame:[[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds]];
    // Override point for customization after application launch.
    
    _rootController = [[MXSideMenuViewController alloc] init];

    FirstViewController* first = [[FirstViewController alloc] init];
    SecondViewController* second = [[SecondViewController alloc] init];
    ThirdViewController* third = [[ThirdViewController alloc] init];
    
    [_rootController addViewController:first Title:@"First" Icon:@"icon_radar.png"];
    [_rootController addViewController:second Title:@"Second" Icon:@"icon_radar.png"];
    [_rootController addViewController:third Title:@"Third" Icon:@"icon_radar.png"];
   
    self.window.rootViewController = _rootController;
    
    [self.window makeKeyAndVisible];
    return YES; ```
